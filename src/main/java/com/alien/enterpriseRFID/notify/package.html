<body bgcolor="white"><p>The notify classes work in conjunction with a reader running in autonomous
    mode. In autonomous mode the reader is set up to read tags over and over again
    without the need for human interaction. If tags are found (or removed), the
    reader can be configured to send messages to listening services on the network.
    The notify classes implement these listening services, constantly waiting and
    listening for notification messages from readers, and converting these messages
    into Java objects.</p>
