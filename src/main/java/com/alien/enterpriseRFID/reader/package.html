<body bgcolor="white">The Reader classes are the primary classes for communicating with a reader
either over the network or serial port.

<p>Typically the Reader object will be obtained from a Discovery Item object,
    discussed in the last section. However if the location (either serial port name
    or network address) is known, a Reader object can be instantiated directly
    without the need of any discovery classes. Once a valid reader object is
    available, it offers the user a number of simple commands that implement the
    full command set described by the Reader Interface Guide.</p>
