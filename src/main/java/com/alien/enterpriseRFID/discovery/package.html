<body bgcolor="white"><p>In order to use and control a reader, its network address of the serial port
    number of the host must first be known. The AlienRFID.jar library provides all
    the classes needed to automatically search for and discover readers using both
    of these connection modes.</p>

<p>Both of the discovery classes (serial and network) return discovered readers
    as DiscoveryItems. This class contains a number of key information points that
    allow any software system to identify and contact the reader in question.
    Information such as the reader name, type and address.</p>
