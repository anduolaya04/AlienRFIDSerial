<body bgcolor="white"><p>Tags play a very important part in the RFID reader and tag system. For this
    reason there is a single class devoted to storing and manipulating tag
    information: the Tag class. More classes are provided that help the developer work
    with tag data. These additional classes are TagTable and TagUtil.</p>
